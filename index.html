                    <h2>How I improved the website</h2>
                    <p>
                       To improve this project I focused on completing the user journey by adding another checkout-page and a completed checkput-page. I changed how the checkout-form works in terms of errors to be able to take the user to the next page only when the user provided the needed information. If found it hard to add the error messages as the user fills out the form, so I added placeholders to show the user how to fill in the different fields to prevent the user from being confused.

                    <h2>How I improved the website</h2>
                    <p>
                        To improve the semester project I wanted to add some Javascript to the site, so I chose to make a donating page where a potential donater can donate to the museum and choose which amount of money they want to donate. I also read the feedback from the teachers so I integrated the logo more into the header and changed the hover properties on the buttons to make sure they didn't move the page. There also were some issues with the images being different sizes on the exhibition page when view in Firefox, so I fixed this by changing the property width to min-width.
