                    <h2>How I improved the website</h2>
                    <p>To improve the cross-course project I focused on completing the user journey by adding another checkout-page and a completed checkput-page. I changed how the checkout-form works in terms of form-errors to be able to take the user to the next page only when the user provided the needed information. If found it hard to add the error messages as the user fills out the form, so I added placeholders to show the user how to fill in the different fields to prevent the user from being confused. The code of this isnt very realistic but that was the only way I found it to work partly as I wanted.</p>
                    <p>I also removed the select form on the jacket-specific-page and replaced it with radio buttons so that one of the sizes were checked by default, which made more sense.</p>
                    <p>I changed some of the button's values and added a transition to hover on click-able items. I also added loaders and changed the main element if there are any errors in JS. I also added a footer to make it more realistic.</p>

                    <h2>How I improved the website</h2>
                    <p>To improve the semester project I wanted to add some Javascript to the site, so I chose to make a donating page where a potential donater can donate to the museum and choose which amount of money they want to donate. This is the page you find after clicking the "donate" button on the get-involved page.</p>
                    <p> I also read the feedback from the teachers so I integrated the logo more into the header and changed the hover properties on the buttons to make sure they didn't move the page. There also were some issues with the images being different sizes on the exhibition page when view in Firefox, so I fixed this by changing the property width to min-width.</p>

                        <h2>How I improved the website</h2>
                        <p>To improve the exam project I made a header image for both the mobile version and desktop version to give the user a bit more impression of what the website is about.</p>
                        <p>I read through the feedback I got and was able to remove the error which closed the modal when clicking on the modal itself. I did not solve the repeating code in the blog-post JS file.</p>

                    <h2> My thoughts on the year and my progress</h2>
                <p>I didn't know what to expect when I started this year considering that I've never actually had any experience with coding or computers in general. As a complete beginner it was hard to understand how everything worked, there were a lot of "basic" terms that were completely new to me so it really was a process to grasp the whole subject.</p>
                <p>I've defintaly learned that the more you practice yourself - the more you learn. I found it to be hard to read about coding and to try and understand it in my head. Testing it out and seeing what worked and what didn't made it easier to understand. I've really started to understand CSS a bit more than I used to. JavaScript is the language I struggle with, and I find it to be somehow similar to math which I also struggle with. I am starting to notice some improvement though, so I just have to practice more.</p>
                <p>I am overall pleased with my websites and the progress I've made, though I would've liked progressed a bit more with JS and adding it to my websites. </p>
